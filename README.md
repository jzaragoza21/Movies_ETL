# Movies_ETL

## Purpose

Amazing Prime was impressed with the movie database but wants it updated on a daily bases. Therefore, we set out to perform an analysis to create an automated pipeline that reads new data, performs transformations to clean and condense the data, and loads the data into existing tables. We took the code we created for module work and refactored it to perform functions that are more streamlined and efficient. The results of this work are in the screenshots of my resource folder, as well as the ETL files in this repo.
